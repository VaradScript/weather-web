# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

> **Note**: For longer README files, I usually add a "Back to top" buttton as shown above. It makes it easy to navigate.

This is where your installation instructions go.

You can add snippets here that your readers can copy-paste with click:

```shell
gh repo clone navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme
```


# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

You have people who want to use your project and then you have people who want contribute to your project.

This is where you provide instructions for the latter.

Add instructions on how to set up a development environment, clone, and build the project.

You can use the code snippets here as well:

```shell
command to clone your project
command to build your project
command to run your project in development mode
```


# Contribute
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)


# License
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

You can also mention what license the project uses. I usually add it like this:

[MIT license](./LICENSE)
